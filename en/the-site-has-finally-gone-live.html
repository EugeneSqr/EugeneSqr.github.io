<h4 id="atlast">At last</h4>
<p>I'm excited to announce my site's first release! Although it isn't feature rich I consider this event as a very important milestone in my development career.</p>
<p>It's all began in 2012 when I first published my thoughts into Internet <a href="http://eskurikhin.blogspot.com">using blogspot</a> blogging platform. I was writing mainly about .net stuff and only in English.</p>
<p>A year ago I came to conclusion that I didn't want to be a pure .net developer. Instead I wanted to expand the boundaries and explore things outside of Microsoft's ecosystem. I installed Linux and started playing around Node, Mongo, Angular, JavaScript, C and vim.</p>
<p>Two month before this day I decided it's time to examine my new skills. By that time I had something around 20 posts in my blog and I wasn't really happy how blogger was serving them. So I started working on this site during my spare time.</p>
<p>What are the key features?</p>
<h4 id="thissiteisfast">This site is fast.</h4>
<ol>
<li>I keep the number of dependencies to an absolute minimum so I can have full understanding of what's going on and can fix any problems without being locked in third party tool restrictions.</li>
<li>I don't implement anything I don't really need. If something is no longer needed, it gets fully removed.</li>
<li>I treat the content as a main value of this site; therefore I don't use any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">"WYSIWYG"</a> editors to produce result html (which in many cases is far from ideal). Instead I balance productivity with markup clarity by using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="thesiteisbilingual">The site is bilingual</h4>
<p>I maintain two versions (English and Russian) of content plus static labels and headers. It basically means two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don't wan't to write something trivial or duplicate someone's articles; because in this case I have to translate it which is tedious. It's a good motivation to focus on my personal experience.</li>
<li>I have to rethink a post each time I translate it; which also improves quality (especially spelling :)).
Let's not forget that English is my second language so it's a good opportunity to improve my writing skills. If you found any problems in text (grammar, style etc.) please don't hesitate to tell me.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="responsivedesign">Responsive design</h4>
<p>I use bootstrap 3.0 + less to manage my css. This results in terse code that works well on majority of devices.</p>
<h4 id="alltoolsandcomponentsarefree">All tools and components are free.</h4>
<p>I use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux Mint Debian Edition as development OS;</li>
<li>vim as a text editor;</li>
<li>NodeJS, ExpressJS - backend; AngularJS - frontend; Mongo - data storage. JavaScript everywhere!</li>
<li>misc: git, selenium, markdown, jasmine, bootstrap, less, bower and others.</li>
</ul>
<p>The absence of proprietary software makes the project really personal.</p>
<h4 id="futuredevelopment">Future development</h4>
<p>Here is the list of must have features I plan to add next release:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/en/post/google-analytics-in-angular">Google analytics</a>;</li>
<li>Post list paging;</li>
<li>Spell checking strategy;</li>
<li><a href="/en/post/dates-localization-in-angular">Client side dates localization in angular;</a></li>
<li>Improve storage structure to reduce content duplication across languages; </li>
<li>Migrate more articles from blogger.com</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it hope you enjoy it.</p>
